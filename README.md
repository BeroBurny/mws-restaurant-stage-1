#  Restaurant Reviews App
Udacity project for Front End Web Developer Nano Degree

### Usage?
1. Inside HTML files `index.html` and `restaurant.html` change field `[API_KEY]` whit your [Google Map API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

2. Go to your working directory and start server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`(in some case you only need to use `python` instead of `python3`).  
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
